Video Upload, Sensitivity Processing,
and Streaming Application Assignment
Overview
Build a comprehensive full-stack application that enables users to upload videos, processes
them for content sensitivity analysis, and provides seamless video streaming capabilities
with real-time progress tracking.
Project Objectives
Core Functionality
1. Full-Stack Architecture: Develop using Node.js + Express + MongoDB (backend)
and React + Vite (frontend)
2. Video Management: Implement a complete video upload and secure storage system
3. Content Analysis: Process videos for sensitivity detection (safe/flagged
classification)
4. Real-Time Updates: Display live processing progress to users
5. Streaming Service: Enable video playback using HTTP range requests
6. Access Control: Implement multi-tenant architecture with role-based permissions
Technical Requirements
Backend Implementation
● RESTful API Design: Create endpoints for video operations
○ Video upload with metadata handling
○ Video listing with filtering capabilities
○ Streaming service with range request support
● Content Processing: Implement a video sensitivity analysis mechanism
● Real-Time Communication: Use Socket.io for live progress updates
● Database Management: Store video metadata, processing status, and user data in
MongoDB
● Authentication & Authorisation: Secure API endpoints with proper validation
Frontend Development
● Upload Interface: User-friendly video upload with progress indicators
● Real-Time Dashboard: Dynamic display of processing status and progress
● Video Library: Comprehensive list of uploaded videos with status indicators
● Media Player: Integrated video playback for processed content
● Responsive Design: Cross-platform compatibility and intuitive user experience
Advanced Features
Multi-Tenant Architecture
● User Isolation: Each user accesses only their own video content
● Data Segregation: Secure separation of user data and permissions
● Scalable Design: Support for multiple organisations or user groups
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
● Viewer Role: Read-only access to assigned videos
● Editor Role: Upload, edit, and manage video content
● Admin Role: Full system access, including user management and system settings
Video Processing Pipeline
1. Upload Validation: File type, size, and format verification
2. Storage Management: Secure file storage with proper naming conventions
3. Sensitivity Analysis: Automated content screening and classification
4. Status Updates: Real-time progress communication to the frontend
5. Streaming Preparation: Video optimisation for efficient streaming
